Ingredients:

1 (14.1 ounce) package pastry for a 9-inch double-crust pie
Â¾ cup white sugar, or more to taste
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
6 cups thinly sliced apples
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).

Line a 9-inch pie dish with one pastry crust; set second one aside.

Combine 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Add more sugar if your apples are tart.

Layer apple slices in the prepared pie dish, sprinkling each layer with cinnamon-sugar mixture.

Dot top layer with small pieces of butter. Cover with top crust.

Bake pie on the lowest rack of the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until golden brown and filling bubbles, 30 to 35 minutes more.

Serve warm or cold.
